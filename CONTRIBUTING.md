2. **Make your changes** and add tests if needed

3. **Run tests** to make sure everything passes:
   ```bash
   go test -v ./...
   ```

4. **Commit** with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of what you did"
   ```

5. **Push** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear description of what you changed
   - Why the change is needed
   - Any relevant issue numbers

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Keep functions focused and small
- Document exported functions

## Testing Guidelines

- Unit tests for all conversion logic
- Test both success and error cases
- Add benchmarks for performance-critical code
- Verify multi-platform compatibility when possible

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug? Have a feature request?

1. **Check existing issues** first
2. **Open a new issue** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (OS, Go version, fizzy-md version)

## Feature Requests

We love new ideas! When suggesting a feature:

- Explain the problem it solves
- Show example usage
- Consider backward compatibility
- Think about impact on performance
